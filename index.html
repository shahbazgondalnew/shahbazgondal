                <p class="date">Course Project</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a Flutter application that generates and displays questions using OpenAI's GPT-3 API. The project involved setting up necessary dependencies, creating a CreatedQuestion widget, integrating the API to fetch questions, and displaying them in a dynamic list. Additionally, implemented functionality to save the generated questions as a PDF file, demonstrating skills in API integration, state management, and file handling in Flutter.</li>

                    <li>Developed a process for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA to mimic specific writing styles. The project explores various data preparation approaches, including question-answer formatting, question generation, and neutral text generation. It involves extracting text from PDFs, converting it to JSON format, and consolidating the data for fine-tuning. The implementation includes a code snippet for extracting text from PDFs, converting text files into JSON, and consolidating data. Additionally, the project demonstrates fine-tuning LLaMA using LLaMA Factory with dependencies installed and executed via LLaMA Board.</li>

                    </div>
                    <li>Designed an interactive dashboard for visualizing shapefile data using Streamlit, a Python library for web applications, and GeoPandas for geospatial data handling. The project uses Matplotlib for visualizations and involves loading shapefile data with GeoPandas, displaying the data in a Streamlit app, and creating map visualizations. The load_data function caches shapefile data to enhance performance, while the dashboard sections allow users to view shapefile data attributes and visualize them on an interactive map. This project showcases how to leverage Streamlit and GeoPandas to create user-friendly applications for geospatial analysis and visualization.</li>
                    <li>Python script for web scraping, utilizing the requests library to retrieve web pages and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing and data extraction. The script employs a function, scrape_and_save, which takes a URL and a CSV filename as input, retrieves and parses webpage content, extracts relevant elements (images, videos, paragraphs, headings, links), and saves the data to a CSV file using the save_to_csv function. The extracted data is organized into a pandas DataFrame for structured storage. This project demonstrates how to automate data collection from websites, emphasizing the importance of respecting website policies and terms of service for legal and ethical compliance.</li>
